> to develop the technologies and strategies for future developments particularly in the areas of identity management and user centric systems, and to improve the practices, policies and technologies surrounding Access and Identity Management within institutions so that they can meet their moral and legal obligations, increase organisational efficiency and flexibility, and improve user experience."

The programme has the following objectives:

1. Continue the evolution of the UK HE Access and Identity Management structures, which began with a centralised system with ATHENS, within an international context; this consists of embedding the current institution centric approaches whilst investigating user centric approaches.
2. To raise the profile of Identity Management within FHE, highlighting the importance in having the correct processes and policies in place and how these lead to improvements in efficiencies and effectiveness and reduced costs.
3. To show how to incorporate rapid technological changes in Access & Identity Management and how these might potentially impact on HE and the UK federation.

It will also involve identifying and addressing particular use cases in UK further and higher education, for researchers, teachers, learners, librarians, managers and support staff, where these use cases clearly affect institutions‟ effectiveness and efficiency.

Previous work within the programme has looked at embedding institution-centric approaches based on standards and technologies such as SAML and Shibboleth whilst investigating user-centric approaches. As more user-centric approaches become more established the programme will look at how these can be embedded within institutions and what the benefits are of doing so.

a. User centricity (OAuth)

JISC is particularly interested in seeing innovative and new uses for OAuth. Bids should show how this technology brings benefits to the community and can help address institutional requirements within research, teaching and learning, work based learning, administration and Business Community Engagement.

b. Cloud Computing

For example, how can the different Levels of Assurance, depending on how a user has logged in to their institution, be applied when accessing Cloud resources? How can users be assured that security and privacy issues are being dealt with effectively when they are using Cloud solutions for storing and processing their data? How can we ensure that users can access Cloud services using single sign-on? JISC has been following with interest the work of SURFnet139 in building a new collaboration infrastructure, SURFconext140. Is this a potential solution for UK FHE to create a collaboration infrastructure, providing access to Cloud services? There are also emerging standardisation activities about identity on cloud services.

c. Persistence of identity

there are still barriers to using social IDs within scholarly research143. These include persistence, privacy concerns and the authority of any information associated with the identity. In addition, many academics perform different roles within their institution (teaching, research, administration and work-based learning) as part of their job. JISC is interested in bids that explore these issues from both user and institutional perspectives.

d. Identity and identifiers

The AIM funded GRAND146 project worked on enhancing Newcastle University‟s Identity Management infrastructure by providing a group management service that would enable greater delegation of control to non IT staff. This project made particular use of Internet2's Grouper (Groups Management Toolkit)147. JISC is interested in projects that further explore the delegation of access controls within institutions.

e. Delegation

f. Inter-federation

g. Bridging between technologies.

What are the issues involved when embedding Access and Identity Management solutions into different platforms, for example adding UK federation functionality via single sign-on into a portal, Virtual Research Environment, etc? Also, with technologies such as Moonshot152, OAuth, OpenID, and Facebook Connect – are there ways to bridge between these and the UK federation? Would a link between an Identity Provider and a Moonshot RADIUS server, via the UK federation, solve many of the issues researchers and scientists have with connecting their resources, particularly Grid and Cloud resources, with the UK federation? Project Moonshot is currently in a pilot phase, but this is due to complete by spring 2012. Moonshot has been developed to satisfy a demand from the e-science and e-research communities, “to develop a single unifying technology for extending the benefits of federated identity to a broad range of non-Web services, including Cloud infrastructures, High Performance Computing & Grid infrastructures and other commonly deployed services including mail, file store, remote access and instant messaging”. However, it is not an alternative to Shibboleth. JISC welcomes projects that explore the connectivity between the two technologies, particularly those that benefit researchers.

Bids are welcomed that look at innovative technologies and issues within Access and Identity Management and how these can be addressed.

Proposals are invited which show an innovative approach and use of access and identity management related technologies, particularly those that have an impact across domains and communities:

a. User centricity
b. Cloud Computing
c. Persistence of identity
d. Identity and identifiers
e. Delegation
f. Inter-federation
g. Bridging between technologies

Projects should consider use cases including but not limited to research, teaching and learning, library and administration, business and community engagement and work- based learning. Projects which cover a number of areas or which bridge between the Access and Identity Management programme and other JISC programmes, such as Managing Research Data, Repositories, Virtual Research Environments, Research Tools, Research Information Management, Business and Community Engagement, e- Learning, etc. are particularly welcome.

It is important that projects seriously consider the sustainability of any outputs produced. JISC is not seeking projects which offer a purely technical solution and isolated to Access and Identity Management alone: projects should consider the institutional or infrastructure context and problem that they are trying to address.

One of the purposes of the Access and Identity Management programme is to identify requirements for, and potential enhancements to, the UK federation and fund projects that can be moved to services or enhancements within the UK federation. Another purpose is to raise the importance of related issues within institutions and to help assist in finding effective solutions.

# Objectives

Proposals should consider how they contribute to the objectives of this strand which are to:
a raise the profile and enhance understanding of the importance and benefits of Identity Management within FHE, highlighting the importance in having the correct processes and policies in place and how these lead to improvements in efficiencies and effectiveness and reduced costs
b determine how to incorporate rapid technological changes in Access & Identity Management and how these might potentially impact on FHE and the UK federation.
c build on work that comes out of previously funded projects (JISC and non-JISC funded). This could be done, for example, by enhancing tools that enable researchers (although not just restricted to this user group), to more easily use the UK federation to access wikis, VREs, etc.
d. highlight Access and Identity Management issues within other JISC programmes. These issues could relate to data management, collaborative environments, business and community engagement, repositories, access to Cloud resources, etc.
e. improve the usability of AIM related tools.

# Requirements

Projects should adopt a methodology that is relevant to projects with short timeframes.

Projects should implement a technological solution, framework or standard that has a benefit to a specific community, but the potential to benefit the wider community. Any tool may be enhanced to make it better fit with the requirements of its potential users.

It is the responsibility of any funded project to highlight their work within their institution, in particular the benefits of the work being undertaken. Raising the awareness of Identity and Access Management issues is a key requirement of this call. Bids should be backed by senior management at a departmental level and also have institutional backing for their work.

To move towards a sustainable model once JISC funding ends. This could involve working with the UK federation if developing a service, embedding within an institution, or for exploratory projects to consider how they might be embedded or built upon. Projects are required to look beyond the official end date of the project and to think about addressing issues of sustainability and take-up.

# Outputs

Projects outputs are expected to include (but are not limited to) the following:

a. Case studies of how the work undertaken has successfully impacted institutions and the community, met requirements and addressed known issues. These may take the form of reports published on the project's web page or as blog postings, for example.

b. How the work has helped a particular group of users. Details of how the communities were engaged and the impact made to a specific community should be included in project documentation.

c. A web presence and use of social media to highlight the benefits of the work undertaken and reach out to as wide an audience as possible.

d. Documentation as stipulated in JISC‟s Project Management Guidelines (http://www.jisc.ac.uk/fundingopportunities/projectmanagement.aspx).

e. Details of how the work will be continued beyond JISC funding of the project must be included.

35. Bids should clearly describe the following:

a. The tool, standard, technology being developed.

b. Identify the community that will benefit from this work and exactly how they will benefit.

c. How the outputs will benefit the wider community.

d. The benefit to the institution.

e. How awareness of Access and Identity Management issues will be raised within the project's institution.

f. Usability – review technical solutions and see how these can be improved for the users.

g. How the project intends to progress beyond the end of the funding from JISC.

UAG (SAML) bridge to OAuth (Unified Access Gateway)

UAG doesn't bridge non-MS products. Library use case is user experience. 'Consistent sign on', rather than 'single sign on'.

[SAMLPHP](http://simplesamlphp.org/) as representative of what we might produce.

Diagrams for where we are, where we intend to go.
