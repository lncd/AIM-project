# PROJECT TITLE GOES HERE.

This project will provide a detailed case study of the use of OAuth as an authorisation protocol at the University of Lincoln. Working closely with the university Library, we will examine how the OAuth 2.0 specification can be integrated into a single sign on environment alongside Open Athens, EZProxy and Microsoft's Unified Access Gateway.

Our intention is to show how OAuth 2.0 can be used as part of an access and identity environment in higher education that provides a consistent yet flexible sign-on experience for staff, students and visitors.
