## Linkey

This project will provide a detailed case study of the use of OAuth as an authorisation protocol at the University of Lincoln. Working closely with the university Library, we will examine how the OAuth 2.0 specification can be integrated into a single sign on environment alongside Microsoft's Unified Access Gateway.

Our intention is to show how OAuth 2.0 can be used as part of an access and identity environment in higher education that improves the student experience by enabling:

* A consistent sign-in experience

* A richer exchange of user information between applications

* Easier development and implementation of new products.
